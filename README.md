# SorterApp
The program is a sorter of people based on their first, second, third or last names.
 
Highlights of the program:
 
1. For the correct operation of the program, you must have a file with a list of names to sort (unsorted-names-list.txt) in the working directory. Inside the file, each new person’s name must be written in a new line. The file must be in a TXT format.
2. While starting the program, use the numbers from 1 to 5 to select the type of sorting.
3. The program automatically creates a file with sorted people’s names in the working directory (sorted-names-list.txt). Each new request rewrites the file (sorted-names-list.txt).
4. While sorting by parameters (first given name, second given name, third given name), if such names are absent, the person is placed at the top of the sorting file and left unsorted. Further, the names which can be sorted by the given parameter are placed.
5. If you have any questions or suggestions, or if you would like further information, please don't hesitate to contact the developer at blackdi85@yandex.ru or blackdi85@gmail.com.
